## About Me

I’m a researcher interested in AI agents, hierarchical reasoning, and preference-based systems. Previously, I was a Research Scholar at Cohere Labs, where I worked on personalization and multi-adapter architectures. Before that, I was at UCL, Microsoft, and Pomona College. I love [jazz piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFoapxPvZy4), my dog [Coco](https://www.instagram.com/coco_buttersun/), and noodle soups (especially [麵線](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misua)).
